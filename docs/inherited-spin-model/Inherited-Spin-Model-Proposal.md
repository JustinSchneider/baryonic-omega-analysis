## 1. Executive Summary

The **Inherited Spin Model (ISM)** posits that the universe is not the interior of a static Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, but rather the interior of a rotating black hole solution (Kerr-de Sitter). By utilizing **Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble (ECSK)** gravity, the ISM proposes that the "Dark Sector" is not a particle field, but a geometric artifact of **background torsion** and global rotation.

This framework integrates the **Secrest Dipole** (cosmic anisotropy), **Direct Collapse Black Holes** (early structure), and **Galactic Kinematic Offsets** (rotation curves) into a single geometric narrative: our universe inherited angular momentum from its progenitor.

## 2. Motivated Hypothesis: The Observational Tensions

The ISM is motivated by three persistent empirical anomalies that challenge the standard isotropic model:

- **The Secrest Dipole Tension:** Quasar distributions at $z \sim 1.5$ show a dipole amplitude $\sim 2\sigma$ larger than the kinematic prediction, suggesting an intrinsic preferred direction in the manifold.
- **The Flynn Correction ($\omega$):** Galaxy rotation curves are better fit by a linear velocity offset ($\omega R$) than by NFW halos. The ISM investigates if this $\omega$ term correlates with cosmic orientation.
- **Impossible Early Growth:** Observations of over-massive black holes at $z > 10$ (UHZ1, LRDs) contradict hierarchical assembly, favoring a "Black Hole First" geometric origin.

**The Hypothesis:** Our universe originated via a torsion-mediated "Big Bounce" (Poplawski, 2010) inside a parent Kerr black hole. This process conserved the parent's angular momentum, establishing a universal background torsion field ("the current") that continues to influence galactic kinematics today.

## 3. Pillars of the ISM

### I. Cosmic Inheritance (The Manifold)

The universe possesses a "handedness" or vorticity inherited from the parent black hole's spin axis. This global shear provides a natural explanation for the alignment of the **Secrest Dipole** and CMB anomalies ("Axis of Evil").

### II. Structural Inheritance (The Seeds)

Galaxies form **Black Holes First**. The high-density, high-vorticity environment of the ECSK bounce triggers **Direct Collapse Black Holes (DCBHs)**. These "Heavy Seeds" act as the anchors for early galaxies, explaining the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) mystery.

### III. Kinematic Inheritance (The Current)

"Dark Matter" effects are the phenomenological signature of **Metric-Torsion Coupling**. In this view, galaxies are not embedded in halos of unseen particles, but are rotating against a background torsion field. The linear velocity term ($\omega$) found in the Flynn correction is the measurement of this coupling.

## 5. Mathematical Gaps

The ISM requires formal derivation to address the following:

The ISM requires formal derivation to address:

1.  **The Omega Mapping:** Deriving the Flynn linear term ($\omega$) from the non-relativistic limit of the Belyaev-Shapiro Lagrangian.
2.  **Lensing via Torsion:** A primary criticism of non-DM models is the Bullet Cluster. The ISM must demonstrate that **massive torsion fields** can deflect light (lensing) in the absence of baryonic mass, effectively mimicking a dark matter halo's lensing signature.
3.  **Spin Attenuation:** Modeling the transition from baryonic dominance (inner galaxy) to torsion dominance (outer galaxy) at the observed **0.3 normalized radius** interface.

## 6. Conclusion

I propose that the "Dark Sector" is a geometric artifact of ignoring torsion in a rotating manifold. While I lack the differential geometry tools to derive the field equations, the observational alignment between the Secrest dipole, high-$z$ assembly, and galactic kinematics is striking. I invite collaboration to determine if the math supports this synthesis.
